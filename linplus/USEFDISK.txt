HOW TO CREATE PARTITIONS
Use the following procedures to create partitions.

CREATE A PARTITION USING fdisk
To create a partition using fdisk:

1.

Assume superuser privileges.

2.

Enter fdisk {device name}

3.

At the interactive prompt, enter p to list the existing partitions.

4.

Enter n to start creating a partition.

5.

If necessary, enter the desired partition type.

6.

Enter the desired partition number.

7.

Enter the desired first sector.

8.

Enter the desired size of the partition:

•

Enter the desired last sector exactly.

•

Enter the number of sectors to increment starting from the first sector you chose earlier.

•

Enter the bit size that the partition should be in the format +#{K,M,G,T,P} where # is any integer.

9.

Enter w to write your changes and exit the utility.

REMOVE A PARTITION USING fdisk
To remove a partition using fdisk:

1.

Assume superuser privileges.

2.

Enter fdisk {device name}

3.

At the interactive prompt, enter p to list the existing partitions.

4.

Enter d to start removing a partition.

5.

Enter the partition number of the partition you want to remove.

6.

Enter w to write your changes and exit the utility.

CREATE A PARTITION USING GNU PARTED
To create a partition using GNU Parted:

1.

Assume superuser privileges.

2.

Enter parted {device name}

3.

At the interactive prompt, enter print to list the existing partitions.

4.

Enter mkpart to start creating a partition.

5.

Enter the desired partition name.

6.

Enter the desired file system type.

7.

Enter the desired start of the partition in the format #{unit} where # is any integer and unit is MB, GB, TB, etc. The start value corresponds to a location on the physical drive in the context of its total bit size.

8.

Enter the desired end of the partition in the format #{unit} where # is any integer and unit is MB, GB, TB, etc. Note that this is the end of the partition from the beginning of the drive, not from the start value you just defined.

Note: Your changes are saved automatically.

9.

Enter quit to exit GNU Parted.

REMOVE A PARTITION USING GNU PARTED
To remove a partition using GNU Parted:

1.

Assume superuser privileges.

2.

Enter parted {device name}

3.

At the interactive prompt, enter print to list the existing partitions.

4.

Enter rm to start creating a partition.

5.

Enter the partition number of the partition you want to remove.

Note: Your changes are saved automatically.

6.

Enter quit to exit GNU Parted.

CREATE A FILE SYSTEM ON A PARTITION
To create a file system on a partition:

1.

Assume superuser privileges.

2.

Enter mkfs.{file system type} {device or partition name}

3.

Verify that the results indicate the file system was created.
